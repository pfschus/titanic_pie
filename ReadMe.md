# Git repo for our Titanic data analysis project

Patricia, Ivan, Evgeny

We are going to work on the Titanic data set provided by the [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview).

# To Do Items

## Future

[ ] Transform columns for new information.  
[ ] Other ML algorithms  
[ ] Use siblings, children
